# 1.1.0
> I (@kleber24021) have decided that enough advances have been made to jump in 0.1 in the version number :laughing:
- All dynamic parts of the main webpage are functional.
  - Header (although code is not pretty) works and looks cool.
  - Topnavbar is also working.
  - Sidenavbar works and looks pretty cool.
- New images (higher resolution) are now in /assets/a.
- Jquery has been installed and ~~surprisingly~~ it works.
